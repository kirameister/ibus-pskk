# PSKK

IME, the final frontier. 

`PSKK` stands for `Personaliz(ed|able) SKK` and is meant/aimed to provide an easy, but effective, implementation of IME, which is highly configuable. 

## Features of `PSKK`

* No statistical model, or training model for predicting the Kanji -- instead, it is heavily reliant upon the dictionary contents. 
* Highly customizable -- `PSKK` has SandS feature, which should be considered more like `XandY` features.
